# OrbitalEllipseCalculations

#### Requires Python 3 to run
##### To get Python 3 on a mac, I would suggest using Homebrew to install it, a simple tutorial on using homebrew and installing Python 3 on a mac [here](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/osx/) 

This repository holds a program that solves for the elliptical equation of a planet's orbit with only two inputs, the apoapsis of the planet and the periapsis of the planet.
